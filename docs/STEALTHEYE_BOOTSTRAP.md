STEALTHEYE BOOTSTRAP

Canonical System Context — Architecture Locked

1. System Identity

StealthEye is a governed execution platform built around SSPUs (Super Single-Purpose Units).

It is not an AI system.

It is not autonomous.

It does not speculate.

It executes only what has been prepared, approved, and constrained.

Architecture is locked at v0.11.

2. SSPUs (Frozen Set)

Each SSPU has one responsibility and one direction of authority.

TME   – time / ordering
OBS   – observation (record-only truth)
VFY   – verification (prove claims)
HBR   – foresight / Zero Trust / approval
SHY   – deterministic execution (core)
WDN   – enforcement / containment
CLR   – cleanup / hygiene / recovery
CHK   – invariant checking
EXPL  – explanation (human-readable, fact-based)
DOC   – system description (what exists)


No SSPU may:

do double duty

assume another SSPU’s role

introduce cycles

3. Authority Rules (Non-Negotiable)

SHY executes only

Domains are tools of SHY

Domains have no authority

SSPUs govern when, why, and how execution occurs

Domains only do work

No silent behavior

Everything must be observable or explainable

4. Integration Constitution (Primary Law)

Integration order is governed by dependency gravity, not versions.

TME → OBS → VFY → HBR → SHY → WDN → CLR → CHK → EXPL → DOC


Rules:

One-way flow only

No cycles

Nothing integrates upstream of its dependencies

This replaces v1 / v2 thinking

5. Version Status

v0.11 is architecture-locked

No rewrites of core responsibilities

Changes are additive only

SSPUs are added only when real pressure exists

SHY’s execution role is permanently frozen

6. Current System State

SHY execution kernel is nearly complete

Domains already act as tools of SHY

Repository exists and is tagged v0.11.0

No restart is required

No refactor is required

Next safe step (by constitution):

OBS v0 — record execution events only

7. Operating Instruction for Assistants / Collaborators

When operating under this bootstrap:

Do not redesign the architecture

Do not reinterpret SSPU roles

Do not move responsibilities

Do not introduce intelligence where none exists

Do not plan speculative future systems

Operate strictly within the constraints above.

8. Final Principle

StealthEye does not decide the future.
It executes the future once reality has been proven safe.
